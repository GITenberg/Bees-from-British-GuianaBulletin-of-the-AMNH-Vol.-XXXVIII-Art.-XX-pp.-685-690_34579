<h2><b>Article XX.</b>&mdash;BEES FROM BRITISH GUIANA</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">By T. D. A. Cockerell.</span></h3>


<p>In connection with the work of the Tropical Research Station of the
New York Zoological Society, conducted by Mr. William Beebe, collections
of insects, including bees, were made. The present report deals with a
series of bees from the Bartica District, and Mr. John Tee Van, in forwarding
them, states that "almost all of these bees were procured about a clump of
several species of nightshades (<i>Solanum</i>), which were flowering in thinned-out
jungle." I give an artificial key, which will enable one who is not a specialist
in bees to separate readily each species from the rest. It will, of course,
remain necessary to compare any species with a fuller account to make
sure that it is not some form unrepresented in the present collection. The
types of the new species and varieties from British Guiana are deposited
in The American Museum of Natural History. Species marked P. are from
the Penal Settlement; those marked K. occur at Kalacoon.</p>

<h3>NOTES AND DESCRIPTIONS</h3>

<p><b>Melipona interrupta</b> (Latreille).&mdash;In the specimen sent, the bands
on second and following segments are notched above in middle, with only
an obscure linear interruption.</p>

<p><b>Melipona fasciata barticensis</b> Cockerell.&mdash;One specimen has five
linear red bands on abdomen, but in another the bands are very indistinct,
almost obsolete.</p>

<p><b>Melipona intermixta</b> Cockerell.&mdash;The ground color of the first three
abdominal tergites varies; in the lighter forms that of the first is pale fulvous
with the shoulders blackish, of the second and third clear ferruginous.</p>

<p><b>Euglossa singularis</b> Mocs&aacute;ry.&mdash;Judging from the brief description, it
appears that <b>E. meliponoides</b> Ducke is probably the same species.</p>


<p class="center"><b>Euglossa decorata</b> Smith, var. <b>ruficauda</b>, new variety</p>

<p>Both sexes with abdomen ferruginous, apically more or less dusky, but
the whole effect lighter and redder than typical; scutellum green with the
hind margin red. Tuft on female scutellum light fulvous. The female,
from Kalacoon, (Hym. 212) is the type of the variety.</p>


<p class="center"><b>Euglossa ignita</b> Smith, var. <b>chlorosoma</b>, new variety</p>

<p>Green, without coppery tints, but variably suffused with purple. It is
smaller than <i>E. piliventris</i>, with shorter mouth-parts, and the labrum pallid
with a pair of dusky spots. A male in the U. S. Nat. Museum from Bartica,
which I reported as <i>E. piliventris</i>, belongs here. Female <i>E. piliventris</i> has
long yellow hairs on the anterior margin of hind basitarsus, but in <i>chlorosoma</i>
the hair in this situation is black. The type of the variety is a female
labelled Hym. 140. A female from Kalacoon has brassy and coppery tints
on the apical part of abdomen, and must be referred to <i>E. ignita</i> proper.
The type locality of <i>ignita</i> is Jamaica.</p>

<p><b>Ceratina l&aelig;ta</b> Spinola. This was described from the female. The
specimen sent is a male, and differs from the female in being smaller, and
having a transverse band on anterior margin of clypeus, triangular marks
on lower corners of face, and a large patch (emarginate above) on labrum all
ivory-white. This is very like <i>C. viridula</i> Smith, which Ducke considers a
synonym of <i>l&aelig;ta</i>, but the base of the metathorax seems to differ, and the
nervures are piceous. For the present, therefore, I retain <i>C. viridula</i> as a
distinct species. The female of <i>C. viridula</i>, collected by Busck in the
Panama Canal Zone, is also distinguishable from that sex of <i>C. l&aelig;ta</i>.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_689" id="Page_689">[Pg 689]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><b>Epicharis maculata</b> var. <b>barticana</b>, new variety</p>

<p>&#9792;.&mdash;Base of mandibles with a large cuneiform yellow mark; a broad
black band down each side of labrum; yellow spots on prothorax large;
scutellum with a pair of large transversely oval yellow areas, separated by a
narrow black band; band on second abdominal segment with a posterior
median projection. Kalacoon, 1916. (Hym. 217.)</p>


<p class="center"><b>Rhathymus beebei</b>, new species</p>

<p>&#9792;.&mdash;Length about 22 mm., anterior wing 18 mm.; head clear ferruginous,
with red hair, lower part of face more pallid, with a creamy tint;
apical half of mandibles black; clypeus prominent, minutely roughened,
with a smooth median line; mesothorax black, with a median ridge, the
surface on each side of this strongly punctured, but shining between the
punctures; rest of thorax ferruginous, and all of thorax with ferruginous
hair; scutellum not bigibbous, but with an elevated transverse ridge; pleura
with a blackish area below the wings; lower part of mesopleura with a
shining tubercle; tegul&aelig; clear ferruginous, finely punctured; wings strongly
reddened; legs clear ferruginous; abdomen fusiform, shining; first two
segments dull reddish, pallid posterolaterally, the others reddish black, with
the hind margins redder; apical plate very large, concave. Bartica District
(Hym. 19). Very distinct by the transverse straight ridge on scutellum;
nearest perhaps to the considerably smaller <i>R. unicolor</i> Smith, but that has
dark fuscous wings. The antenn&aelig; are unfortunately missing.</p>


<p class="center"><b>Augochlora callichlorura</b>, new species</p>

<p>&#9792;.&mdash;Length a little over 7 mm.; first two abdominal segments rather
weakly vibrissate on hind margin with orange hairs; hind spur of hind leg
with long spines. Head and thorax very dark purplish, nearly black, but
a blue-green spot at upper end of clypeus, supraclypeal area brilliant purple,
and base of metathorax strongly tinged with purple; anterior and middle
legs dark, with weak purple tints, but hind femora, tibi&aelig; and basal half
of basitarsi all brilliant green on outer side; abdomen short and broad,
shining, very brilliant emerald green. Head broad, eyes strongly converging
below; clypeus with extremely large punctures; front dull and granular;
ocelli ordinary; cheeks with thin white hair; mesothorax and scutellum
shining, but well punctured; base of metathorax with strong short plic&aelig;;
angles of prothorax not prominent; tegul&aelig; rufotestaceous; wings grayish
translucent, stigma and nervures dusky pale brown; first recurrent nervure
meeting second transversocubital; abdomen with thin pale hair, hind
margins of segments not darkened. Bartica District.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_690" id="Page_690">[Pg 690]</a></span></p>
<p>Unique by the combination of purplish head and thorax and green abdomen,
the general effect recalling <i>A. atropos</i> Smith.</p>


<p class="center"><b>Florilegus barticanus</b>, new species.</p>

<p>&#9794;.&mdash;Length about 11 mm.; black, except as follows: first abdominal
segment strongly greenish; clypeus and labrum entirely yellow; mandibles
fulvous apically (but base black); antenn&aelig;, except the first two joints,
ferruginous beneath; hind tarsi, and apex of hind tibi&aelig;, dusky red; hair of
head and thorax ferruginous, paler below, no admixture of dark hairs;
eyes reddish; mesothorax shining, but distinctly punctured; tegul&aelig; clear
ferruginous; wings dusky hyaline, nervures reddish fuscous; legs with pale
hair, conspicuously plumose on hind tibi&aelig;; abdomen with four broad dense
ochraceous hair-bands, that on fourth segment broadly excavated in middle
posteriorly, on fifth broadly interrupted; sixth segment with a small patch
of fulvous hair on each side; apical part of abdomen dorsally, except for the
bands and patches, with very dark fuscous hair. Bartica District (Hym.
11).</p>

<p>Related to <i>F. lanieri</i> Gu&eacute;r. from Cuba and <i>F. condigna</i> Cresson from the
United States. In the coloration of the legs it is intermediate between these
two.</p>

<p><b>Tetrapedia lacteipennis</b> Vachal.&mdash;It should be added to Vachal's
description, that the dorsal abdominal segments 2 to 4 have yellow bands.</p>

<p>The Bartica collection contains a <i>Megalopta</i> from Hoorie, but it is
unfortunately broken. I have <i>Megalopta panamensis</i> Cockerell from
Maroni, French Guiana (Queensland Museum, 42).</p>

<p>I add the description of a new species from French Guiana, the type of
which is in my collection.</p>


<p class="center"><b>Augochlora maroniana</b>, new species</p>

<p>&#9792;.&mdash;Length slightly over 8 mm.; head, thorax and legs bright green; abdomen
yellowish green strongly suffused with coppery, the first two segments with apical
fringes of orange hair; face rather narrow; antenn&aelig; black; lower middle of clypeus
black; mesothorax and scutellum rough with dense punctatures, the scutellum with
two copper-red spots; area of metathorax with very feeble plic&aelig;; tegul&aelig; black with
pallid margin, the basal side broadly green; wings dusky; second s. m. square;
first r. n. meeting second t. c; stigma dusky reddish; legs with mainly pale hair,
hind tibi&aelig; with dark hair on outer side basally; hind spur with about six long spines;
basal half of basitarsi green on outer side; abdomen shining, with pale ochreus hair.</p>

<p>Maroni, French Guiana (Queensland Mus., 43). Related to <i>A. cupreola</i> (Ckll.),
but with the vibrissate fringes on abdomen nearly twice as long, and deep orange-fulvous,
and the mesothorax much more densely punctured. Also related to <i>A.
diversipennis</i> (Lep.), but with the face much narrower, and the area of metathorax
much less distinctly plicate. From <i>A. calypso</i> Sm. it is known by the wings not being
yellowish, the inner orbits not edged with blue, and the tarsi not ferruginous.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
